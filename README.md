## Features
- Create groups and add members.  
- Record expenses paid by any member.  
- Automatically updates everyoneâ€™s balances (who owes and who is owed).  
- Members can settle up directly on-chain by paying back what they owe.  
- Balances are always transparent and auditable on the blockchain.

## Example

### Scenario
- **Bob** pays `90 ETH` for a hotel in a 3-person group (Alice, Bob, Carol).  
  - Each owes `30 ETH`.  
  - Balances â†’ Alice: `â€“30`, Carol: `â€“30`, Bob: `+60`.  

- **Alice** pays `60 ETH` for dinner.  
  - Each owes `20 ETH`.  
  - Balances â†’ Alice: `+10`, Bob: `+40`, Carol: `â€“50`.  

- **Carol** settles up with Bob by calling `settleUp()` and sending ETH.  
  - Funds are transferred directly.  
  - Balances reset fairly.

## Why FairShare?
FairShare demonstrates how Web3 can bring **transparency, fairness, and automation** to everyday activities like splitting bills.  
By recording group expenses on-chain, everyone can see exactly who owes what, and settlement happens **without intermediaries**.
